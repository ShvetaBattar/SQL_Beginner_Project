In this Repo, beginners  go through the process of working with an unstructured layoffs dataset using SQL. The project focused on three key areas:

1. Data Cleaning: The first step focused on preparing the dataset for analysis. This included removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, eliminating null and blank values,
 and discarding any columns that were not relevant to the analysis.These actions ensured a clean, reliable dataset for further exploration.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): After cleaning the data, we conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends. Using SQL, we generated descriptive
statistics and visualizations that provided insights into the datasetâ€™s structure, helping to identify key areas of interest for deeper investigation.

3. Deriving Insights: The final task involved extracting actionable insights from the data. We analyzed trends such as the distribution of layoffs across industries
  and time periods, providing valuable information that could inform business decisions.

This project reinforced foundational SQL skills but also demonstrated the practical application of data cleaning, EDA, and insight generation.
